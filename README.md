## Overview

The NEAR AI Cookbook demonstrates various use cases and integrations with the NEAR AI infrastructure. It showcases how to leverage NEAR's ecosystem for AI-powered applications, including sentiment analysis, data processing, and agent-based decision making.

## Features

- Starter kits and templates for building AI-powered applications on NEAR
- Integration guides for key NEAR AI ecosystem projects (e.g., Hyperbolic, Mintbase)
- Reusable components for common AI functionalities (e.g., prediction markets, NFT creation)
- Best practices for implementing AI models and algorithms on NEAR
- Tools for enhancing AI accuracy and performance (e.g., RAG implementations)
- User authentication and wallet integration examples
- Scalable and modular architecture designs for AI dApps


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)
- [NEAR CLI](https://docs.near.org/tools/near-cli#setup)

You'll also need:

- A NEAR account. If you don't have one, you can create it using [NEAR Wallet](https://app.mynearwallet.com/). or [Testnet Wallet](https://testnet.mynearwallet.com)
- API keys for services used in the examples (e.g., [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart), Pinecone). Refer to the `.env.example` file for the required keys.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/near/near-ai-cookbook.git
   cd near-ai-cookbook
   ```
2. Navigate to /examples/examples repo
     ```
   cd examples
   cd <example-name>
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
   - Fill in the required API keys and configuration values

## Usage

1. Run the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to explore the examples.
